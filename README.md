File Scanner Script üõ°Ô∏è

This script scans a specified directory for suspicious files (e.g., `.exe` or `.dll`) that could potentially be harmful. It provides an easy way to monitor directories and identify potentially malicious files.

 Features ‚ú®

- Scans directories recursively for files with specific extensions (`.exe`, `.dll`).
- Prints a list of suspicious files found in the directory.
- Simple to use and customize.

 Getting Started üöÄ
 Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of how to run Python scripts.

 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-scanner.git
   cd file-scanner
   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

 Usage

1. Open the script `scan_files.py` in a text editor.

2. Modify the directory to be scanned by changing the argument in the `scan_files()` function. For example:

   ```python
   scan_files("C:\\")  # Change to the desired directory path
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scan_files.py
   ```

4. The script will output the results, listing any suspicious files it finds.

Example Output

If suspicious files are found:

```plaintext
Scanning C:\ for suspicious files...
Suspicious files found:
C:\Windows\System32\example.dll
C:\Program Files\malicious.exe
```

If no suspicious files are found:

```plaintext
Scanning C:\ for suspicious files...
No suspicious files found.
```


 Customization üõ†Ô∏è

- **Add more extensions**: Modify the `if` condition in the script to include additional file types:

  ```python
  if file.endswith('.exe') or file.endswith('.dll') or file.endswith('.bat'):
  ```

- **Change directory to scan**: Replace `"C:\\"` with any path you want to scan.
